This is a place for some of my work that does not have another home (yet). I find it
immensely more rewarding to have a dedicated spot to publish such explorations and side projects
rather than leaving them to be forgotten on a hard drive. I also learnt that formalizing thoughts
and concepts helps me to actually memorize them. And I hope that having these things nicely
organized will make it easier for me to reuse them.

Although I am not necessarily aiming for it, I would be very happy if any of the content here is useful
to someone else than me. If it is, please feel free to reuse it as you see fit: All *original content*

this in any way!
