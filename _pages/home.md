I am passionate about building robust, extensible software that empowers researchers.

I am a major contributor to the [GROMACS project](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/),
one of the leading molecular simulation software packages. Since 2017, I have spearheaded the
effort to rewrite the main simulator loop. The new, modular design cleanly defines data
dependencies, massively improves maintainability and extensibility, and allows for multi-step
integrators and task-based parallelism. It also includes a Monte Carlo framework, allowing for
high-performance hybrid MC/MD algorithms in GROMACS. I have also contributed significant
improvements to the unit and regression testing framework.

I am the main developer of [physical_validation](https://physical-validation.readthedocs.io),
a Python package testing molecular simulation results for their physical validity.
The quality of predictions based on molecular simulations depend on the  validity of the
underlying physical assumptions. `physical_validation` allows users of molecular simulation
programs to perform simple yet powerful tests of physical validity on their systems and setups.
It can also be used by molecular simulation package developers to run representative test
systems during development, increasing code correctness.

During my PhD studies at ETH Zurich, I worked on protocols for property calculations in force
field development, statistical physics and the sampling from physical and artificial ensembles,
and electrostatic interactions in molecular dynamics.

In my free time, I love exploring the mountains - on skis, running, or climbing.
